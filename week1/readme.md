# What I learned in Week 1
## Python
### This week I learned how to print strings and numbers, set and use variables, and use loops
### I also learned how to incorporate data in variables, and calculate them in my coding for science camp. I want to start next week by reviewing this.
### I practiced nested loops in my Argonne coding camp, and tried applying what I learned in week1.py
## VS Code
### I learned what the terminal is, how to navigate virtual studio, and get comfortable with the program.
## Git 
### I started by installing and testing git on virtual studio. 
### I learned a few commands to use in git to create, save, and push a repository.
### Will keep reviewing and getting comfortable with the commands needed to use git
